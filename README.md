# Defect Detection and Classification in Carbon-Fibre Composites
**Ke24066**

*MSc Data Science Dissertation | University of Bristol*

-------------

## Overview

This repository contains an MSc Data Science dissertation project which investigates at the process used to identify and classify defects in carbon fibre composite materials by segmenting them into separate groups.  The project tests the performance of SimTex, a deep learning model for semantic segmentation, on various datasets via image-based techniques and building on recent improvements in phase segmentation of uncured prepreg micrographs.

Two sets of synthetic images that resembled like real-world composite defects were used. The main defect classes were **tows**, **wrinkles**, and **stitches/gaps**.  Detailed ground-truth annotations were made by hand for these images so that quantitative benchmarking could be performed.  We used the **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**, which is a strong metric for evaluating imbalanced segmentation tasks, to compare these with the predicted masks generated by SimTex.

## Repository Contents

- `mcc.ipynb`: Evaluation notebook with MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) calculations, visualisations, and overlays.
- `pix/`, `pix 1/`: Original images which were annotated and used for analysis and prediction comparison.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Project Contributions

- A curated and annotated dataset for defect benchmarkingÂ 
- A modular pipeline for computing MCC and developing visual overlays
- In-depth performance information, such as comparisons of the best and worst cases

The best prediction achieved an MCC of **0.9683**, indicating excellent model-ground truth agreement. Visual overlays further illustrate strong alignment in most cases, while also revealing boundary-level mismatches in others.
